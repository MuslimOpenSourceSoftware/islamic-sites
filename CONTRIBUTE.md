+ All the lists start with an Index, the idea is to show all of sections and subsections there, so it's important to have an index for each section. Right now it's alphabetized, so please use alphabetic order.
+ Sections are using level 3 heading (in HTML is `<h3>`, in Markdown is `###`), and subsections are using level 4 (in HTML is `<h4>`, in Markdown is `####`).
+ We prefer small commits rather than one large commit in a pull request. If you don't have the time to make small commit, add an issue with all the links included and we'll add them for you.

The idea is to have
+ `2` empty lines between last suggested book & new header
+ `1` empty line between header & first book of that very section.
+ `0` empty line between each book in 1 section.
